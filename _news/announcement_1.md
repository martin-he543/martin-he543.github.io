Hello world! This is the site of the fourth-iteration of my website!

**WARNING:** What follows in an over-excited blog post created at midnight after trying for several hours to deploy this site onto GitHub, and after tweaking with godknows how much (S)CSS and Javascript.

Sooooooooo.... I decided to impromptu create a website, because I lost an eBay auction to a bid sniper, which got me incredibly vexxed. *It was only a bid, it was only a bid!* Nevertheless, incensed by such masteful tactics, I resolved that the only course of action to complete on an uneventful January day would be to create this website as quickly as humanely possible.
