## <a class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.5s">welcome to my virtual abode.</a>

<br />

##### <a class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.5s">I am a First Year undergraduate <sup>[citation needed]</sup>  at Bayes Business School studying Business Analytics, with a little Japanese and French *on the side.* Previously, I have dabbled in experimental Physics, and I am working on learning C(++), advanced linear algebra, as well as Markov chains.</a>

<br />

<a class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s">Other than academic stuff, I am a decent pianist, and working on self-composing various pieces (piano and otherwise), primarily in the neo-Classical style, though I tend to disregard genres for the most part. I also work on piano arrangements if I have any spare time, and music production in Logic Pro X (or Ableton Live). Please follow me on Strava if you like MTB or running and shit. Follow me on Instagram for personal schenanigans.</a>
